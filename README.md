# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_POPULAR_MOVIES-_DATA

During my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze popular movies using a comprehensive dataset. The dashboard provides in-depth analysis through various metrics, including average ratings, relevance scores, and counts of total movies, unique users, ratings, tags, genres, and genome tags. These key performance indicators (KPIs) offer valuable insights into movie trends and user engagement.This project not only enhanced my skills in movie trend analysis but also deepened my understanding of Power BI visualization techniques. By interpreting user preferences and movie data effectively, I was able to create a tool that presents clear and actionable insights. The project files are available on GitHub for further reference and development, providing an opportunity to build upon and extend the analysis.
